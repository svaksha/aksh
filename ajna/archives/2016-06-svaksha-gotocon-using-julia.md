# ABSTRACT
{{*Detailed description - public, if talk is accepted, one paragraph, maximum 400 characters.*}}

Software programming is an ongoing process that starts with the choice of the programming language. With the choice of the language, a programmer's journey has just begun -- she has to design the programs, code it, test it, and then, refactor and maintain the software. Julia is a new scientific computing language in the computing landscape. Its dynamic features improve the scientific and numerical computing experience. In this talk session, along with an introduction to the Julia language basics, you will learn the language features and advantages of Julia, then look at code samples for various tasks. It will also cover its uses in the research world and show how you can leverage the language into your programming and/or research processing tasks. You will leave the talk equipped with techniques for evaluating and managing your scientific computing processing tasks.

# DETAILS
{{*Detailed description. Will be made public if the talk is accepted.*}}


### Objectives
{{*What will attendees get out of your talk? When they leave the room, what will they know that they didn't know before?*}}

The attendees (programmers and users) will ...
+ get introduced to the Julia programming language,
+ have an overview of different libraries currently available,
+ researchers can try the simple syntax and the libs available,
+ leave the talk with a good understanding of scientific programming in Julia,
+ understand how they can incorporate Julia code within their current codebase,
+ want to use Julia for analysing large distributed datasets. 

My talk will use Jupyter notebooks for the presentation with multiple slides in each notebook and the entire presentation will be released under the Foss/CC licence in the [IRA](http://svaksha.github.io/ira) repo on github and these can be downloaded, edited and re-used with proper attribution under the same licence and copyright terms by anyone.

# BIOGRAPHY
{{*Anything else you'd like the program committee to know when making their selection: your past speaking experience, open source community experience, etc.*}}

I am a computing technologist and [Foss contributor](http://svaksha.com/pages/Bio) who has spoken at coding camps and technical conferences like [Pycon-CA](http://2012.pycon.ca/talk/29). Recently, my talk "[Bootstrapping your Foss journey with Julia](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/svaksha/ira/blob/master/2015-07-fsmkcamp/00_index.ipynb)" at FSMK-Camp was very well received and an the Engg student attendee blogged my talk as "worth it .. [higher standard](http://harikavreddy.blogspot.in/2015/07/i-always-wanted-my-holidays-to-be.html)". 

Here is a detailed list of my print [publications and technical talks](http://svaksha.com/pages/Publications) presented at conferences. The Jupyter notebooks and slide materials used in my talks and presentations (including conference proposals) have been released under the AGPL/CC licenses in the [IRA](http://svaksha.github.io/ira) repo on github.


## Additional Speakers
{{*If more than one speaker is presenting, add their details below*}}
