# Advice - Programmer
### Work on personal projects!
+ It is the best way to learn new technologies that you may not have a chance 
to try out at work.  When it comes time to use it, you'll be the smarty-pants 
who already knows all about it.  
+ Or it will be another item for your resume, the next time you go looking for 
a new job.  Bonus:  This will also give you code samples that don't belong to 
your previous employer.  
+ Planning and executing a personal project will also 
make you a more confident programmer, because you know that you can build 
something

### Know the code.
+ Never cut-and-paste anything you don't understand. If you're borrowing 
somebody else's code, you better damn well study it and learn how it 
works. 
+ You are responsible for ALL the code you contribute to a project -- even 
if it was originally somebody else's code.  If there's a bug in there, you 
better find it and fix it.  If there's a security flaw, you need to fix that, 
too.  
+ Many code samples online do NOT represent production code.  They exhibit 
irresponsible error handling, insufficient security, and are organized in such a 
manner that they won't scale in a healthy way.

### Don't ask for help too soon.  
+ Always give yourself a chance to figure something out on your own.  
+ While asking for help will save you time, you will develop a deeper knowledge 
of the technology if you solve problems on your own than if someone dictates the 
answer to you.

### Be Flexible.
+ Don't get suckered into dogma.  This field is always changing, and we have to 
stay flexible with it.  While it's important to respect best practices, it's 
also important to be open to learning new ways of looking at things.  
+ Embracing anything as religion in our field will hamper your ability to learn 
new things, and will also make you less capable to adapt to changes taking place 
around you.

### Always a learner.
+ Your education is never complete and you will learn new things every day.  A 
lifetime of learning is good for your brain -- it will keep it young and nimble.
+ Always be open to learning
+ Balance learning programming with domain knowledge and design/system thinking

### Develop yourself internally
+ Get a life outside of work. The pace of technology is fast and you have a 
lifetime to learn. Programming is an intense profession, you will burn out at 
some point.  Having a life outside of programming can help to prevent the burn 
out.  If you live and breathe programming, when you are on a shitty project, it 
will be hard to separate yourself from the project and you may get stuck.  I 
can't see a way to solve the problem, because I don't have a necessary level of 
detachment.
+ Grow as a person, not just as a developer. Not everyone loves personal 
projects and avoid thinking less of those who dont. Some people enjoy having a 
life outside of programming, which has no bearing on their job efficiency.  
+ Having external hobbies or outside interests will give you different ways of 
thinking about problems and better people skills, hence making you a better 
programmer and person.

### Know yourself
+ Know how you learn.
+ Know what gets you intellectually excited
+ Know what keeps you engaged and excited
+ Play, a lot.
